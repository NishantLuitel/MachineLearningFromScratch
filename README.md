# ML-From-Scratch

#### This project aims to implement many traditional machine learning algorithms from scratch using only Numpy. I also compare my implementation of these algorithms with Scikit-learn algorithms by comparing performance evaluation on benchmark datasets.

### Currently Implemented Algorithms:
+ Clustering Algorithms:
  - Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
  - K-means Clustering
  - Spectral Clustering
+ Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms:
  - Isomap
  - PCA
  - Kernelized PCA
  - Multi-Dimensional Scaling(MDS)
  - Random Projection
  - Spectral Embedding
+ Linear Methods:
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)
  - Linear Regression (Unregularized, Ridge and Lasso)
  - Logistic Regression



#### Note: I am currently working on this project. I hope to add about 10 more algorithms to this repository.
