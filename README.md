# ML-From-Scratch

#### This project aims to implement many traditional machine learning algorithms from scratch using only Numpy. I also compare my implementation of these algorithms with Scikit-learn algorithms by comparing performance evaluation on benchmark datasets.

### Currently Implemented Algorithms:

Note: I am currently working on this project. I hope to add about 10 more algorithms to this repository.
